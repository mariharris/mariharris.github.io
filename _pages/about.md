I am a 6th year PhD candidate in the [biomathematics](https://compmed.ucla.edu/) program at UCLA, working under [Nandita Garud](https://garud.eeb.ucla.edu/). I am interested in undersanding the tempo and mode of adaptation in natural populations. Specifically, I use statistics, deep learning and computational population genomics to detect signatures of positive selection in genomic data.
